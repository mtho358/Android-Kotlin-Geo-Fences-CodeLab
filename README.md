# Android-Kotlin-Geo-Fences-CodeLab
The app you will create in this codelab is a Treasure Hunt game. This app is a scavenger hunt that gives the user a clue, and when the user enters the correct location, the app will prompt them with the next clue, or a win screen if they have finished the hunt.

The screenshots below show a clue and the win screen.

Note: That the current game code has San Francisco locations hardcoded, but you will learn how to customize the game by creating your own geofences to lead people to places in your area.
